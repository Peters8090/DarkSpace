In the game you have to destroy all the enemy spaceships. The level is higher, the game is more difficult. Your score is the total time, in which you were killing the opponents. You can blow up the bombs and move the player with a virtual joystick. Remember that some kind of enemies is able to shoot! Your highscore is the least score. If you are shot you can revive by watching an ad, return to main menu or start the game from the beginning. Project created: January 2018 (I didn't use GitHub)
